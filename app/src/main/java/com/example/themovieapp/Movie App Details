1. what is UseCase

All operations within the MVVM structure define in the ViewModel classes. In this case, after a certain
Point, there will be to many ViewModel Classes. All this business logic, the whole load of work
starts to get messy in the ViewModel classes.

In fact, after a point, same thing are located in the different ViewModels classes.

To avoid this complexity, we create various UseCases classes to reduce burden on the ViewModel classes and
 reduce code duplication and complexity.


 The Layers

 1. Presentation Layer :- The layer interact with the user. this layer including activity, fragment, viewModel classes

 2. UseCases :- The Layer where user's work to defined.

 3. Domain :- The layer where business logic operations are performed. for example entity,value objects,
               exception handling, and logic operations are in this layer.

 4. Data Layer :- It is the layer where source of all abstract data is. All data and model that
                  application can use are located in this layer.

 5. Framework :- The layer that interact with the SDK of framework, so that is, implements the interaction
                 with the Android SDK and provide custom implementation for the Data Layer.
